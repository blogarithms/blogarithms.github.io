# Update 07/09/2018

I'm planning to refactor Leonids theme!!!

The goal is really simple: make documentation more intuitive and deployment simpler!!!

Here is the plan:

| Version | Description | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1 | Jekyll version deployable with gem | 07/15/2018 |
| 1.2 | New features: Pagination, Prev/Next post | 07/22/2018 |
| 2.0 | Gatsby or Vuepress version (vote in Issues) | who knows... |

As the project was and will be designed to improve your writing experience, only documentation, gem, deployment process with CI relevant PRs are acceptable in the future.

I want you to know how much I value your support.

Share it to your timeline!

Important! It's better to download the gzipped files instead of forking the repo. I would really appreciate if you could give me a star. üòÅ
