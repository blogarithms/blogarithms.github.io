I've always wanted to write about this, because this has been a running thought in my head for almost years now. 

So here goes!

For those unfamiliar with the phrase, "imposter syndrome" is a psychological frame of mind where the person doubts their capabilities & accomplishments, and believes unquestionably that they are a fraud and have succeeded only by luck.

In other words, it's when someone's being too hard on themselves and not giving themselves credit for what they've really achieved.

**And it's extremely common, in software development**. The reason I can say that with such confidence, is because EVERYONE wants to solve it.

The list of articles go on, but my underlying point is - I'm not alone in this. So yay!

The first time I felt a wave of imposter syndrome wash over me was when I first tried my hand at open-source back in my freshman year.

I claimed an issue and submitted a pull request - and shortly recieved some comments about my code.

The comments, while pointing out a typo or an optimization that could be made, were also breaking my fragile self-esteem and faith I had in myself as a developer.

But yeah, the pointers I recieved did help me improve my code quality.

After that, I spent some time fixing and improving my previous code. 

Submitted another PR.

This PR now failed **all** the CI/CD tests.

BUT! As it turns out, the reason my code failed all the tests, was because of something not **entirely** my fault. 

The reason was, I was using Windows -- and the environment of the codebase demanded Linux. This is problematic because Windows uses a different "end-of-line" character that's invisible to most text editors. But not to Notepad++, which is what I used to finally get my PR to be merged into the open-source project's codebase.

This was just my first experience with the imposter syndrome.

It started popping in very often, after that.
- the SWE internship at Deloitte at the end of my freshman year.
- starting this technical blog.
- at Harvard's Hackathon (HackHarvard 2017).
- the SWE internship at Cisco at the end of my sophomore year.
- giving a technical talk to **other** CS undergrads.

Every step of the way, I was constantly thinking "Um, hey, I think I'm just lucking out everywhere -- someone pls slow me down."

I think the imposter syndrome is good and bad.

For starters, it's bad because -- well, it feels bad. Nobody wants to feel like a fraud.

Furthermore, I think the field of software development lends itself to imposter syndrome because -

- All work is measurable.

	Owing to time and space complexities, and even otherwise, it's very easy to measure the "efficiency" of solutions. Consequently, I can't help but think any optimizations made to a program over time leads the initial developer to associate the degree of improvement to their lack of skill.

	I wouldn't really feel proud of myself if another developer came in and improved my code by 500% in a few days.


- Global competition.
	
	This extends from programming contests, to open-source PRs, to full-fledged industrial product development. The world of software is very small, and competition is global -- it's not limited by physical/geographic distance.

	Because of this, the quality of competition is insanely high and that's just another reason to not feel comfortable.

- It's easy to forget the difficulty of things.
	
	In the process of comparing, or working alongside highly capable developers, its very easy to lose track of the cutting-edge work or the high quality of development that's going around.

- Accountability for any code failures.

	I'll admit it -- it's scary to be accountable. It's hard to predict if users can break your code. And no matter how much I test it, I think I'll always have that lingering sense of "Have I tested it enough?"


All that being said, I also think the imposter syndrome is a good sign.

Have you heard of the Dunning-Kruger effect?

![dunning-kruger](../../img/dunning-kruger.jpg)

The Dunning-Kruger effect, is the relationship between an individual's perceived knowledge of subject matter, versus their ACTUAL knowledge of it.

Observe the graph - and you'll notice that newbies, and inexperienced developers stay under the assumption that they are familiar with all that exists in the field.

A simpler way of interpreting the graph, is - **The inexperienced do not know what they do not know.**

It's that simple. The experienced developers, or those on the track to becoming experienced, know how vast the field of software development is. 

They know what they don't understand -- and eventually learn and fill in the holes in their knowledge.

So the imposter syndrome is a good thing! It shows that I'm not a newbie or inexperienced -- since I'm aware I have a long way to go. :)

It feels bad, but its also good!
