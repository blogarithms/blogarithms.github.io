<p>So Google Play recently recommended the Google Podcasts App to me, and claimed I might like it.</p>
<p>So I decided to give it a whirl, thinking “Alright, let’s give this a shot. This seems like fun.”</p>
<p>Thus, my journey into the world of podcasts begins. And when I find the time to do so, I’ll write my opinions on here.</p>

<h3><a id="Podcasts_Im_currently_checking_out_8"></a>Podcasts I’m currently checking out</h3><br>
<ul>

<li><strong>The History Of Fun</strong> - The hosts get into the details of the history of a lot of fun stuff. I've listened to their episode on the history of Manga, and I've got a feeling they're going to be a favorite real soon if the quality keeps up across all other of their talks.</li>
<li><strong>This Is Product Management</strong> - A podcast interviewing product managers. I’m hoping it gives me some insights in the overlap of technology and business.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong> - Hopefully this would educate me on the business side of things.</li>
<li><strong>Planet Money</strong> - <em>Imma learn economics!</em></li>
<li><strong>Talk Python To Me</strong> - Seems to be an interesting podcast on Python and its real world applications</li>

</ul>

<h3><a id="Podcasts_Ive_listened_to_and_loved_so_far_16"></a>Podcasts I’ve listened to and loved so far</h3><br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freakonomics Radio</strong> - This podcast is possibly why I'm considering doing a Minors in Economics.</li>  
<li><strong>Linear Digressions</strong> - Two lovely hosts explore ML and Data Science concepts. One of my favorite podcasts to listen to on a way to a class.</li>
<li><strong>Data Skeptic</strong> - This one is also a technical podcast but this is less hands-on and features interviews with field experts. It’s a friendly introduction into the world of ML and Data Science.</li>
<li><strong>The Infinite Monkey Cage</strong> - A whimsical, hilarious and fascinating podcast on Science, this always gets me smiling while simultaneously teaching me something new.</li>
<li><strong>The Weirdest Thing I Learned This Week</strong> - Something I listen to almost every dinner. Great hosts, fun talks, a great time all-in-all.</li>
