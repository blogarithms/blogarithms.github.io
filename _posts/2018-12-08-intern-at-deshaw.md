Recently, D.E. Shaw visited my college with the intention of cherrypicking a student or two who could join them at their Hyderabad Office for the summer, as an engineering intern.

When my college sent us all an email consisting of the shortlisted candidates who can apply, my heart skipped a beat because D.E. Shaw, like other hedge funds, has a reputation of considering only students with an exceptional academic history. 

Upon scrolling through the ~400 shortlisted candidates, I found my name along with some other serious competition.

> *The curtain rises.* - The voice at the back of my head.

Drama aside, the interview process with D.E. Shaw was **extremely** intense and by the end, I felt like only the candidates who impressed **every** interviewer was offered an internship.

The process spanned two days and went as follows -
- Online Round
- Technical Interview 1
- Behavioural Round
- Technical Interview 2

By the end of the process, I was so mentally fatigued, I doubt I'd have been able to implement binary search right after that.

The interviews pushed me to my limits and for a change, I found myself constantly being asked to not only optimize the time complexity of my algorithms, but even the space complexity!

And the level of the algorithmic problems I was asked was so challenging, I was so grateful I had over 2 years of algorithmic programming contest experience.

I mean, how often is a DFS + trie approach the right way to solve the first question of the technical interview, literally 5 minutes into talking?!

And even the online round, the first round which was just the screening test, had a problem based on dynamic programming which I thankfully managed to solve within the allocated time of 20 minutes. 16 students were shortlisted from those 400 candidates. 

After technical interview 1 and the behavioural round, 4 candidates (including me) were taken into the final technical round.

Oh boy, this final round. Oh boy.

The questions spanned dynamic programming, tries, graph theory, clustering algorithms, data analytics, markov chains & NLP, operating systems, compilers, NP-hard problems, open ended discussion problems, and so much more -- it was insane.

> "Sleep. Pls. God. Just. Let. Me. Sleep." - The voice at the back of my head.

The three others and I were made to wait for about 30 minutes and then I was called in.

Finding out that I was one of two students selected, from an initial sample set of **FOUR HUNDRED** students, was unforgettable. I remember feeling numb at the moment - and then having the full impact of what just happened, hit me like a tidal wave the next second.

Relief flooded me from all sides. 

An internship offer from a hyperselective hedge fund? Talk about some validation. :)
