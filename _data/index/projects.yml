  I've built a bunch of stuff over the years.
  <ul>
    <li>This blog</li>
    <li>An Image-to-ASCII-Art Generator</li>
    <li>A Markov Chain that talks like Sherlock Holmes</li>
    <li>A Digital Yellow Rubber Duck Chrome Extension</li>
    <li>A Sublime Text Plugin to pull coding contest questions directly onto the editor</li>
    <li>A crowdsourced lost pet locator platform (Web + Android app)</li>
    <li>An IoT solution to alert the user when an intruder enters their room via Slack</li>
    <li>A movie recommender using collaborative filtering, trained on public datasets</li>
    <li>An algorithm for the autonomous traversal of a student-built Mars Rover</li>
    <li>An emotion recognition algorithm</li>
    <li>A text deanonymization algorithm</li>
    <li>A script to de/encrypt secret text in images -- steganography</li>
    <li>Automated WhatsApp to spam people who annoy me</li>
    <li>A tic-tac-toe bot to win my games for me</li>
  </ul>

  Aside from these, I'm also responsible for setting algorithmic challenges for my own college's programming contests, and
  developing efficient solutions and test cases so that other undergrads can try their hand at solving my own challenges.
