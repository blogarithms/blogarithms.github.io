title: Why Developers Should Blog</p>

<h2 id="permalinkarticles201811whydevelopersshouldblog">permalink: /articles/2018-11/why-developers-should-blog/</h2>

<p>I started blogging over a year ago, now.</p>

<h3 id="andiloveit">And I love it.</h3>

<p>Blogging has changed me, in a myriad of ways.</p>

<p>And that's what I want this article to verbalize.</p>

<p>So here goes!</p>

<h2 id="1reinforcedmytechnicalknowledge">1. Reinforced My Technical Knowledge</h2>

<p>Over a year ago, while I was comfortable with many algorithms and data structures, I didn't have a great understanding of the advanced ones.</p>

<p>Today, after over nearly <strong>30</strong> fully thought-out, published articles, I can confidently say I have become much more comfortable with advanced algorithms too.</p>

<p>Convex Hulls, Segment Trees, Disjoint Set Union, Bitmasks, Difference Arrays, Matrix Exponentiation, and Dynamic Programming are all in my arsenal and I'm no longer hesitant in using them anymore -- and I owe it all to the months of technical blogging, proofreading and verifying, that I had to do.</p>

<h2 id="2taughtmetimemanagement">2. Taught Me Time Management</h2>

<p>Technical blogging is a fairly intensive activity. I need to know the ins-and-outs of my blog post's domain, I need to know what I'm writing, verify what I'm writing, and be able to verbalize what I'm writing and communicate it with either pseudocode or visualizations.</p>

<p>This requres time and patience. Both practically as rare as water in a desert, when it comes to college students.</p>

<p>Being able to work out intricate daily and weekly schedules, and being able to work even in unanticipated situations is a quality I picked up over the last few months, and I believe it will serve me well in the years to come.  </p>

<h2 id="3improvedmycommunicationskills">3. Improved My Communication Skills</h2>

<p>I remember how, months ago, I used to struggle in communicating convoluted algorithms or technical ideas to teammates or friends. </p>

<p>I used to have trouble getting my thoughts in order when I was talking as I was thinking. This even showed during interviews.</p>

<p>But since I started blogging, over the months, I started noticing that I fumbled less. I became more fluent in communicating ideas.</p>

<p>Let me rephrase that.</p>

<h5 id="icouldcommunicatedifficulttechnicalideastoeventheuninitiatedandnontechnicalpeople">I could communicate difficult, technical ideas to even the uninitiated, and non-technical people.</h5>

<p>That's a quality, <strong>every firm needs</strong> in their employees. And evidently, I picked it up without even solely setting out to do so.   </p>

<h2 id="4taughtmewebtechnologies">4. Taught Me Web Technologies</h2>

<p>Hosting this blog and a portfolio website ( <a href="https://rameshaditya.com" target="_blank">https://rameshaditya.com/ </a>) required me to learn how to host webpages, and how to design beautiful and responsive websites.  </p>

<p>I picked up HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and most recently, Ruby and Jekyll!</p>

<p>I've read up on Search Engine Optimization, Marketing, Google Adsense, UI/UX, Git, and other CSS Frameworks too.</p>

<p>No regrets whatsoever! </p>

<h2 id="5givenmeopportunities">5. Given Me Opportunities</h2>

<p>Back when I started, just a few articles in, I found an email in my inbox. </p>

<p>This email was from the founder of a tech firm, whose clients were pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p>He gave me his contact information and invited me to take up a project with his firm, freelance or through an internship.</p>

<p>My point here is, </p>

<h5 id="technicalblogginggotmeinternshipoffers">Technical blogging got me internship offers.</h5>

<p>I continued, and after a few more articles, I pinged Topcoder and they were happy to induct me into their own technical team.</p>

<p>Getting into the Topcoder Team was cool enough, but it gets cooler! </p>

<h5 id="igotasponsoredtriptoattendtopcoderopenindia2018">I got a sponsored trip to attend Topcoder Open India 2018</h5>

<p>That was so much fun! I met some world-class developers, competed with them, ate some tasty food, and had a TON of fun! </p>

<h2 id="6enhancedmypublicreach">6. Enhanced My Public Reach</h2>

<p>I've had recruiters message me asking about my blog. Interviewers ask me about it, friends ask me about it, people I have never met cold contact me about it.</p>

<p>And that's great, because I get to discuss topics I love with people I want to interact with, so it's a win-win!</p>

<p>Best of all, maybe, would be that I've got to interact with some really famous developers who also run blogs -- ONLY because we both had something in common.</p>

<hr />

<p>In summary, blogging is a journey I'm glad I undertook. It's got me to explore my interests, led to opportunities, and helped me make connections otherwise impossible.</p>

<p>Consistent technical blogging has -</p>

<ul>
<li>Reinforced My Technical Knowledge</li>

<li>Taught Me Time Management</li>

<li>Improved My Communication Skills</li>

<li>Taught Me Web Technologies</li>

<li>Given Me Opportunities</li>

<li>Enhanced My Public Reach</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's why, I think every developer should blog.</p>
