## Installation

Minimal Mistakes now requires [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) 2.2+. Make sure to run `gem update jekyll` if you aren't on the latest version or `gem install jekyll` if this is your first time installing it.

If you are creating a new Jekyll site using Leonids follow these steps:

1. Fork the [Leonids](http://github.com/renyuanz/leonids/fork).
2. Clone the repo you just forked and rename it.
3. Update `config.yml`, add navigation, and replace demo posts and pages with your own. Full details below.

If you want to use Minimal Mistakes with an existing Jekyll site follow these steps:

1. [Download Leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids/archive/master.zip) and unzip.
2. Rename `leonids-master` to something meaningful ie: `my_blog`
3. Remove demo posts/pages and replace with your own posts, pages, and any other content you want to move over.
4. Update posts' and pages' YAML to match variables used by Leonids. Full details below.
5. Update `_config.yml` and add navigation links. Full details below.

**Pro-tip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you won't want.

## Running Jekyll

If `jekyll build` and `jekyll serve` throw errors you may have to run Jekyll with `bundled exec` instead.

> In some cases, running executables without bundle exec may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle.
>
>However, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain. Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another machine.

## Scaffolding

How Leonids is organized and what the various files are. All posts, layouts, includes, stylesheets, assets, and whatever else is grouped nicely under the root folder. The compiled Jekyll site outputs to `_site/`.

## Site Setup

A quick checklist of the files you'll want to edit to get up and running.

### Site Wide Configuration

`_config.yml` is your friend. Open it up and personalize it. Most variables are self explanatory but here's an explanation of each if needed:

#### title

The title of your site... shocker!

Example `title: My Awesome Site`

#### url

Used to generate absolute urls in `sitemap.xml`, `feed.xml`, and for generating canonical URLs in `<head>`. When developing locally either comment this out or use something like `http://localhost:4000` so all assets load properly. *Don't include a trailing `/`*.

Examples:

{% highlight yaml %}
url: http://renyuanz.github.io/leonids
url: http://localhost:4000
url: //cooldude.github.io
url:
{% endhighlight %}

#### Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools

Will be working on it in the future.

### New Post

Just create a markdown file named something like: `year-month-day-your-post-title.md` in the directory `_posts`, and here you go.

### New Page

You can create a page by adding directly a markdown file or html file under the root path or a directory with a index page inside. You can check [this page](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/) for more details.

## Layouts and Content

Explanations of the various `_layouts` included with the theme and when to use them.

### Post and Page

These two layouts are very similar. Both have an author sidebar and optional Disqus comments. The only real difference is the post layout includes related posts at the end of the page.

### Post Index Page

A [sample index page]({{ site.url }}/) listing all posts grouped by the year they were published has been provided. The name can be customized to your liking by editing a few references.

### Author Override

By making use of data files you can assign different authors for each post.

Start by modifying `authors.yml` file in the `_data` folder and add your authors using the following format.

{% highlight yaml %}
# Authors

billy_rick:
  name: Billy Rick
  web: http://thewhip.com
  email: billy@rick.com
  bio: "What do you want, jewels? I am a very extravagant man."
  avatar: bio-photo-2.jpg
  twitter: extravagantman
  google:
    plus: +BillyRick

cornelius_fiddlebone:
  name: Cornelius Fiddlebone
  email: cornelius@thewhip.com
  bio: "I ordered what?"
  avatar: bio-photo.jpg
  twitter: rhymeswithsackit
  google:
    plus: +CorneliusFiddlebone
{% endhighlight %}

To assign Billy Rick as an author for our post. We'd add the following YAML front matter to a post:

{% highlight yaml %}
author: billy_rick
{% endhighlight %}

### Social Sharing Links

Social sharing links for Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ are included on posts/pages by default. If you'd like to use different social networks modify `_includes/social-links.html` to your liking. Icons are set using [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io).

---

## Further Customization

Jekyll 2.x added support for Sass files making it much easier to modify a theme's fonts and colors. By editing values found in `_sass/variables.scss` you can fine tune the site's colors and typography.

For example if you wanted a red background instead of white you'd change `$text-color: #444;` to `$text-color: $cc0033;`.
